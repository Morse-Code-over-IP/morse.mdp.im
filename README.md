# Morse Code Headlines

## Credit

Most of the credit goes to [Stephen C. Phillips](https://scphillips.com/) for his excellent [Morse Pro library](https://github.com/scp93ch/morse-pro) which I use to create the mp3 files for the headlines.

## Requirement

- Node >= 13.x
- ffmpeg installed

## Installation

- `git clone git@github.com:mdp/morse_code_news.git`
- `cd morse_code_news`
- `npm install`
- `./generate.sh`
- Wait, this will take a while
